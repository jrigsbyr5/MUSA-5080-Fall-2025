# Lab Setup Instructions

## Overview

Each week, you'll complete lab assignments and add them to your portfolio website. This document explains the one-time setup process and the weekly workflow you'll follow all semester.

## One-Time Setup (Week 1 Only)

### Step 0: Clone the Course Repository

**First, clone the course repository** (you only need to do this once):

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
2. **Navigate to where you want to store course materials:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop  # or wherever you keep school folders
   ```
3. **Clone the course repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MUSA-5080-Fall-2025/MUSA-5080-Fall-2025.git
   ```

**Important:** This creates a **separate folder** from your portfolio repository.

### Step 1: Create Labs Folder Structure

In your portfolio repository, create this folder structure:

```
your-portfolio/
├── _quarto.yml           # You'll edit this
├── index.qmd            # Your home page  
├── weekly-notes/        # Already exists
├── labs/                # CREATE THIS FOLDER
│   └── lab_0/           # CREATE THIS FOLDER
│       ├── lab_0_template.qmd    # You'll copy this file here
│       └── data/        # CREATE THIS FOLDER (copy data folder)
└── ... (other files)
```

**In RStudio:**
1. In the Files pane, click "New Folder"
2. Name it `labs`
3. Inside `labs`, create another folder called `lab_0`
4. Inside `lab_0`, create a folder called `data`

### Step 2: Edit Your Navigation Menu

Open your `_quarto.yml` file and modify the navbar section to add a Labs menu:

**Replace this section:**
```yaml
navbar:
  left:
    - href: index.qmd
      text: Home
    - href: weekly-notes/
      text: Weekly Notes
```

**With this:**
```yaml
navbar:
  left:
    - href: index.qmd
      text: Home
    - href: weekly-notes/
      text: Weekly Notes
    - text: Labs
      menu:
        - href: labs/lab_0/
          text: Lab 0: dplyr Basics
```

**Important:** Make sure the indentation matches exactly! YAML is sensitive to spacing.

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

1. Save your `_quarto.yml` file
2. In RStudio, go to Build → Render Website
3. Check that you now see a "Labs" dropdown in your navigation menu

## Weekly Workflow (Every Lab)

### Step 1: Get the Lab Template

1. Go to the [course repository](https://github.com/MUSA-5080-Fall-2025/MUSA-5080-Fall-2025)
2. Navigate to `labs/lab_X/` (where X is the lab number)
3. Download or copy the lab template files

### Step 2: Set Up Your Lab Folder

1. In your portfolio, create a new folder: `labs/lab_X/`
2. Copy the template `.qmd` file into this folder
3. Copy any data files into `labs/lab_X/data/`

### Step 3: Customize the Template

1. Open the lab `.qmd` file
2. Update the author field with your name
3. Complete all the exercises
4. Fill in all the "[YOUR ANSWER]" sections

### Step 4: Update Your Navigation

Add the new lab to your `_quarto.yml` file:

```yaml
navbar:
  left:
    - href: index.qmd
      text: Home
    - href: weekly-notes/
      text: Weekly Notes
    - text: Labs
      menu:
        - href: labs/lab_0/
          text: Lab 0: dplyr Basics
        - href: labs/lab_1/           # ADD NEW LABS HERE
          text: Lab 1: [Lab Title]
```

### Step 5: Render and Deploy

1. **Build your site:** Build → Render Website
2. **Check locally:** Make sure everything looks good
3. **Commit your changes:** 
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete Lab X: [brief description]"
   ```
4. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
5. **Check your live site:** Your portfolio should update automatically

## Troubleshooting

### "Website won't render"
- Check your `_quarto.yml` indentation
- Make sure all file paths are correct
- Look for typos in file names

### "New lab doesn't appear in menu"
- Verify you added it to `_quarto.yml`
- Check that the `href:` path matches your folder structure
- Make sure you rendered the website after making changes

### "Code doesn't work"
- Check that data files are in the right location
- Verify you're using relative paths: `"data/filename.csv"`
- Make sure you're working within your R project

### "GitHub Pages isn't updating"
- Confirm you committed and pushed all changes
- Check that GitHub Actions completed successfully (green checkmark)
- Wait a few minutes - updates can take time

## Tips for Success

1. **Work incrementally:** Complete one exercise at a time, render frequently
2. **Use descriptive commit messages:** "Complete filtering exercises for Lab 0"
3. **Keep files organized:** Don't put data files in wrong folders
4. **Test locally first:** Always render and check before pushing
5. **Ask for help:** Use office hours or discussion board if stuck

│   ├── week_01.qmd
│   └── week_02.qmd
├── labs/

│   └── lab_2/
│       ├── index.qmd
│       └── data/
│           └── housing_data.csv
└── docs/                    # Generated by Quarto
    ├── index.html
    ├── weekly-notes/
    ├── labs/
    └── ...
```

By the end of the semester, you'll have a professional portfolio showcasing all your data analysis work!
